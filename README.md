# Track_NFT

Project Description:

Track AI assisted generated music to appropriately distribute royalties and and enable hyper-personalised music.

Users upload songs to a mobile app and can then select a voice model that will replace the original vocals using trained voice models.
This would function firstly by isolating the vocals and then applying the target voice data model. Next you would mix the new vocals to 
the melody. 

The connection between the substate parachain and the flutter created front-end has not yet been established.

The idea of utilising a substrate parachain is that since the NFTs would create a lineage, it is convenient to allow the NFTs to exist on
different blockchains. Not restricting the original artists on where to save their creations. The lineage is important because royalties 
would be distributed as proportion to their distance from the original song. I.e. diminishing rate of returns for original artists. The 
lineage is what would be stored on the polkadot parachain. 

This creates a dynamic where original artists no longer copyright strike their work-remakes because it only creates new revenue streams for
them but also allows whichever user to express themselves creatively without the fear of legal issues.
